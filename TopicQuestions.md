What is the overarching goal of your project?

The goal of our project is to find out if we can train an algorithm to outperform the previous implementations of our algorithms for plank's superball project using neural networks.


What is the research question you are trying to address?

Is a genetic algorithm capable of performing well with superball** rephrase


Why is this topic interesting? Why did you select this topic/question in particular and
why did you select the corresponding bio-inspired algorithm?

We want to win planks superball and be at the top of his highscore. We also have had previous experience with superball, and want to outperform our own neural networks with this new neural network. 
We will use genetic algorithm to play superball, as well feel it can be used in these neural networks.


What other academic works are there that are related to this work?

Every student who has taken cs302 as an algorithm attempting to get a highscore with planks superball. Many of them, if not all, are lacking genetic algorithm to accomplish it.


How are they related to what youâ€™re doing?

They are attempting to accomplish the same goal, and our the bases of our project.


What are you doing differently?

We are using genetics algorithms with training, rather than linear methods we learned in cs302
